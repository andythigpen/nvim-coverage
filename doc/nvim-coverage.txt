Julias package manager outputs code coverage files when running package tests
with `Pkg.test(; coverage=true)`. The plugin processes these files using the
`CoverageTools.jl` package, which is expected to be installed in the
`@nvim-coverage` environment. The package can be installed with the following
shell command:

   `julia --project=@nvim-coverage -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("CoverageTools")'`

No other configuration should be necessary, but the following options are
available:

    coverage_file: ~
        File that the plugin will try to read coverage from.
        Defaults to: `"lcov.info"`
    coverage_command: ~
        Command for creating `"lcov.info"` from individual coverage output
        files.

        Defaults to: `"coverage/cobertura.xml"`
    path_mappings: ~
        This allow you to configure how to update the paths retrieved from the
        coverage.
        This can be usefull when your tests are run inside a container.
        For instance if your projet root inside the container is in
        `/var/www/html` you can define the following mapping to retrieve
        relative paths from the coverage report: >
        {
          ["/var/www/html"] = ""
        }
<
        Defaults to: `{}`

Rust (grcov) supports the following configuration options:

    coverage_command: ~
        This command runs to load the coverage and output a JSON report to
        stdout.

        working directory before the command is run.
        Defaults to: `"grcov ${cwd} -s ${cwd} --binary-path ./target/debug/ -t coveralls --branch --ignore-not-existing --token NO_TOKEN"`
    project_files_only: ~
